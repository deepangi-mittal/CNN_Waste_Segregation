# CNN-Based Waste Segregation using Image Classification
Tools: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, CNN, NumPy, Matplotlib

- Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify waste into 7 categories including cardboard, glass, paper, and plastic.

- Utilized image_dataset_from_directory utility to efficiently load and preprocess image data from structured folders.

- Implemented data augmentation techniques to improve generalization and reduce overfitting on the training dataset.

- Fine-tuned the CNN architecture by experimenting with layers, dropout, and batch normalization, achieving improved validation accuracy.

- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

- Visualized training performance and predictions to interpret model behavior and improve classification results.
